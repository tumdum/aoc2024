# Advent of Code solutions 2024

```
Day 01 took    40.2µs to compute (rsum    40.2µs) (with i/o:   165.6µs, rsum   165.6µs)
Day 02 took    66.1µs to compute (rsum   106.3µs) (with i/o:   226.5µs, rsum   392.1µs)
Day 03 took   838.4µs to compute (rsum   944.7µs) (with i/o:   878.9µs, rsum     1.3ms)
Day 04 took   395.3µs to compute (rsum     1.3ms) (with i/o:   460.0µs, rsum     1.7ms)
Day 05 took   737.5µs to compute (rsum     2.1ms) (with i/o:   866.2µs, rsum     2.6ms)
Day 06 took     6.8ms to compute (rsum     8.9ms) (with i/o:     6.9ms, rsum     9.5ms)
Day 07 took     3.5ms to compute (rsum    12.4ms) (with i/o:     3.9ms, rsum    13.3ms)
Day 08 took     7.3µs to compute (rsum    12.4ms) (with i/o:    73.4µs, rsum    13.4ms)
Day 09 took    45.5ms to compute (rsum    57.9ms) (with i/o:    45.6ms, rsum    59.0ms)
Day 10 took   233.6µs to compute (rsum    58.1ms) (with i/o:   283.2µs, rsum    59.2ms)

         Total time for 10 days:    58.1ms (avg per day     5.8ms, med:   566.4µs, min:     7.3µs, max:    45.5ms)
