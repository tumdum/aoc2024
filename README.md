# Advent of Code solutions 2024

```
Day 01 took    27.4µs to compute (rsum    27.4µs) (with i/o:   141.5µs, rsum   141.5µs)
Day 02 took    68.6µs to compute (rsum    96.0µs) (with i/o:   213.7µs, rsum   355.3µs)
Day 03 took   848.6µs to compute (rsum   944.6µs) (with i/o:   896.6µs, rsum     1.3ms)
Day 04 took   386.4µs to compute (rsum     1.3ms) (with i/o:   451.7µs, rsum     1.7ms)
Day 05 took   811.2µs to compute (rsum     2.1ms) (with i/o:   940.3µs, rsum     2.6ms)
Day 06 took     6.7ms to compute (rsum     8.9ms) (with i/o:     6.8ms, rsum     9.4ms)
Day 07 took     3.4ms to compute (rsum    12.3ms) (with i/o:     3.8ms, rsum    13.2ms)
Day 08 took     5.6µs to compute (rsum    12.3ms) (with i/o:    78.7µs, rsum    13.3ms)
Day 09 took    46.8ms to compute (rsum    59.1ms) (with i/o:    46.8ms, rsum    60.1ms)
Day 10 took   231.4µs to compute (rsum    59.3ms) (with i/o:   280.7µs, rsum    60.4ms)
Day 11 took     1.6ms to compute (rsum    60.9ms) (with i/o:     1.6ms, rsum    62.0ms)

         Total time for 11 days:    60.9ms (avg per day     5.5ms, med:   811.2µs, min:     5.6µs, max:    46.8ms)
